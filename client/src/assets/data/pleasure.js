    text: [
      `I remember very well the difficult days I spent in my childhood period because, like all the people of my town, we were very poor and could hardly find a livelihood. For this reason, I was obliged to work to earn some dinars for my mother to afford the living fees. She used to bake some traditional bread, “M’hadjeb”, “Matlou’e” and “Lekhfaf” and to make some cakes like “Makroute” in order that I could sell it in the market or in the street. It was an important experience for me as I learnt interesting lessons in my life. This experience taught me how hard life is, this experience taught me patience and perseverance, it taught me that earning after exerting effort and fatigue is better than gaining in unethical and illegal ways such as fraud and theft. In other words, more precisely, the difficulties and poverty I lived in my childhood taught me manhood and made me a strong and brave man.`,
      `But, I think that during this period I was deprived from many things that every child my
      age loves and needs such as playing, hiking and camping in the beach or forests with friends.
      In addition, it also deprived me from practicing my favorite hobbies because I often had to herd sheep after school.`,
      `To this regard, I hope I will study hard and become a successful doctor or teacher. I wish
      I could earn much money and become a rich man to help young learners pursue their studies
      and concentrate on their education.`,

      `Joanne Kathleen Rowling was born in Chipping Sodbury in 1965. She spent her childhood
      near Bristol. Two of the children she played with were called Potter, a name she liked very
      much. At school, she wasn’t good at sport, but she was very imaginative and very interested
      in languages and she wrote her first story when she was five or six years old.`,
      `After school, she studied French at Exeter University and spent one year in Paris. In 1992, she went to Portugal to teach English. Her marriage to a Portuguese TV journalist ended in divorce and she returned to Britain with her daughter. They settled in Edinburgh. She was out of work and she spent her time writing.`,

      `The idea of telling the story of a boy who was a wizard comes to her in 1990. She continued
      working on the story for several years and finished her novel when she was in Edinburgh.
      Then, she sent it to many publishers who rejected it. Finally in1996, Bloomsbury Children’s Book bought her novel Harry Potter and immediately became a bestseller. Writing is now J.K.Rowling’s full time job.`,

      `When I was a high school student, I had two best friends peter and Jack. They were twin
      brothers. They were very similar with appearances but they had different personalities and dreams.`,
      `The first difference between Peter and Jack was the personality. Obviously, Peter was a good-humored and sociable person. Everybody liked him. He used to tell funny stories to make us laugh. I was very close to him. He always helped everyone around him who faced difficulties. Unlike his brother, Jack was a shy and strict person. He was not friendly so he didn’t have many friends. Everybody felt unfamiliar and careful when meeting him. No one dared to joke with him because of his strictness. People said that they were similar in appearances but they were vastly different!`,

      `The second different feature between Peter and Jack was their dream career. Peter liked
      having a normal life. For example, He thought that studying at university is not necessary to
      succeed. He enjoyed painting and going everywhere, He wanted to be a famous painter.
      Unlike Peter, Jack was more ambitious. He wanted to become a good engineer. He tried his
      best to learn well and his dream became a truth.`,
      `The third different feature between Peter and Jack was the hobby. As Jack was a sociable
      person, he liked wearing T-shirts and jeans with sport shoes and watching comedy films and
      funny stories. Unlike his brother, peter was oldfashioned. He used to wear T-shirt and western style pants with leather shoes. He used to watch documentary films and listened to romantic music.`,
      `In conclusion, although twin brothers are similar in appearances, they are different from
      dreams, personalities, and hobbies.`,

      `When I was at school, I studied different subjects. All my teachers were kind to me but my
      favourite one was my Mrs Johnson. She taught me English. She was young, active and helpful. The majority of the pupils liked and respected her because she was as tender as our mothers and also because she was explaining the lessons in a very simple and attractive way.
      She was so pretty and elegant. I have learnt from her to love myself and care for others. My
      dream was to become a teacher of English and do my best to be loved by my pupils.`,

      my favourite teacher. I’ll write about her today.`,
      `Her name is Katrina Patel, from Delhi. I was a student of class five when I first met her. She
      was our class teacher. She used to teach us English . I have never seen someone speaking
      English well like her.`,

      `She was 26 years old . Her voice was really sweet and she used to recite poems and sing for
      us in the class. I really enjoyed that thing about her. She was very punctual and has never been late in class. Her teaching style was modern and a little bit different from another English teacher. She was innovative and modern.`,
      `She has got an amazing personality, which makes her attractive. Besides teaching, she used to write articles for local newspapers. Her favourite writing topic was history and I loved reading her writings. She was really motivating and marvellous personality that all the students liked. We respected her so much and she loved us, especially when we complete our homework. I wish to meet Katrina again and spend some time with her.`,

      I am now known as an actress and a socialist. I like helping people through charity. When I was young, I had a difficult life. I was poor and I couldn’t get a good education. I have always
      had the dream of becoming a famous person but at that age (between 10 and 20) I was only
      trying to survive. After I grew up, I started working everywhere, I made money and I made
      my dream come true. I became one of the famous millionaires in the world. People used to tell
      me that I can do nothing. But, I did not give up.`,

      We molded animals and birds out of clay. We made ox-drawn sleighs out of tree branches.
      Nature was our playground.`,
      `One day, George Mbekela who was a retired teacher paid a visit to my mother. &quot;Your son is a clever young fellow,&quot; he said. &quot;He should go to school.&quot; My mother remained silent. No one in my family had ever attended school but my father, immediately decided that his youngest son should go to school.`,

      `The schoolhouse consisted of a single room, with a Western-style roof, on the other side of
      the hill from Qunu. I was seven years old, and on the day before I was to begin, my father
      took me aside and told me that I must be dressed properly for school. Until that time, I, like all the other boys in Qunu, had worn only a blanket, which was wrapped around one shoulder and pinned at the waist. My father took a pair of his trousers and cut them at the knee. He told me to put them on, which I did, I have never owned a suit I was prouder to wear than my father&#39;s cut-off pants.`,
      `On the first day of school, my teacher, Miss Mdingane, gave each of us an English name and

      brothers. He is 16 and attends a public high school in a town 40 minutes far from home.
      Miguel lives in a small house. At home, they don´t have running water or electricity.
      Miguel lights up candles every night to do homework. He usually spends 2 to 3 hours
      studying. He is always committed and his teacher at school has told him that he should go
      to college. Miguel is very excited about the idea of going to college.`,
      `Miguel keeps studying very hard and by the end of the year, he is the most outstanding
      student in his class. His teacher reminds him that he should apply to college the following
      year. Miguel knows he needs money to apply. After graduating from school, Miguel finds
      a part time job. It does not pay well but it allows him to earn enough to apply. Later, he is
      accepted at college. He is so happy. As Miguel starts the first year at college, he realizes
      that it is not so easy and he has to study even more than before. He also needs to keep the
      part-time job because he spends on fares, food, books. Unfortunately, his parents can´t help him. At the end of the first year, Miguel has become a more responsible person. He
      has also become mature and more grateful. He has an opportunity that most people in his
      small-town don´t have. He´s earning himself and education. He wants to help his family.
      His biggest dream is to help both of his brothers to earn an education as well. He´s not
      sure when that happens but he knows he will make this dream come true.`,

      I’m an American professional boxer and activist. My nickname is “the greatest”. I’m always calm and cheerful. I am also self-disciplined.`,
      `When I was a child, I believed that humans can fly so I dreamt of flying. But when I grew up I
      discovered that it is impossible for humans to fly. I lived a good life with my parents even
      though I suffered from racism. I had big dreams of becoming a great football player, but my
      dad affected my opinion about that. So, I found myself more interested in boxing. I enjoyed
      fighting and winning. I grew up and I didn’t give up on my dream. I worked so hard to
      achieve it and now here I am; “Muhammad Ali the greatest”`,

      `On February 25, 1964, Clay challenged Sonny Liston for the heavyweight championship of
      the world. Liston retired to his corner after six rounds, Clay became the new champion. Two
      days later Clay shocked the boxing establishment again by announcing that he had accepted the teachings of the Islam. On March 6, 1964, he took the name Muhammad Ali.`,

She was very kind and lovely.`,

      cared and looked-after me. He used to help and encourage me a lot when I could not speak in

      `I spent my childhood in a small village in China. In our village, we grew vegetables, planted paddy and caught fish in the river for our living. We also raised chickens and ducks.
      Sometimes we ate eggs. But mostly we used to sell them for money. The life in the village
      was simple but hard. I didn&#39;t have toys. The only amusement I could have was playing games with other children in front of the house in the evening. I had to go home when it got dark because there was no electricity at that time. We didn&#39;t have electricity inside the house, we used oil lamps to give light. Even though we used to read and write in the dark house. There was no television at that time.`,
      `When I was about 8 years old, China became a communist country. Thus my family&#39;s
      nightmare began. We had to live in a broken small house. They tortured my mother by asking
      her to kneel down on the shelf.. I begged as a child, I had to beg for food. “Please give me
      some food. I haven&#39;t had anything to eat since last night. Please be kind enough to give me some rice”. Wearing a torn dress, I begged for food from door to door in the village. In order to survive, I would go to another door with tears in my eyes. “Poor little girl, you shouldn&#39; tsuffer like this. Come in, quick; don&#39;t let other people see you.” Then that person would close the door and give me food to eat. Now I live in Quebec, Canada. I can&#39;t speak French. But most people here are nice and the place is beautiful. But the memories of my childhood are still haunting me.`,

      near Bristol. Two of the children she played with were called Potter, a name she liked very
      much. At school, she wasn’t good at sport, but she was very imaginative and very interested
      in languages and she wrote her first story when she was five or six years old.`,

Her marriage to a Portuguese TV journalist ended in divorce and she returned to Britain with her daughter. They settled in Edinburgh. She was out of work and she spent her time writing.`,

      `The idea of telling the story of a boy who was a wizard comes to her in 1990. She continued
      working on the story for several years and finished her novel when she was in Edinburgh.
      Then, she sent it to many publishers who rejected it. Finally in1996, Bloomsbury Children’s Book bought her novel Harry Potter and immediately became a bestseller. Writing is now J.K.Rowling’s full time job.`,
